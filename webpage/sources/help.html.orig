	  <p>In order to comply better with good programming practice in
	    Python, the syntax to import the variable names from the data
	    file has been modified since version 3.2.5. The file
	    <code>headers.py</code> is not generated anymore. The statement
	  </p>
	  <p><code>from headers import *</code></p>
	  <p>must be replaced by</p>
	  <p><code>
	      globals().update(database.variables)
	    </code>
	  </p>
	  <p>where <code>database</code>  is the object containing the
	    database, created as follows:</p>
	  <p>  <code>
	      import biogeme.database as db<br>
	      df = pd.read_csv("swissmetro.dat",'\t')<br>
	      database = db.Database("swissmetro",df)
	  </code></p>
	  <p>Moreover, in order to avoid any ambiguity, the operators used by
	    Biogeme must be explicitly imported. For instance:</p>
	  <p>
	    <code>
	      from biogeme.expressions import Beta, DefineVariable, bioDraws, PanelLikelihoodTrajectory, MonteCarlo, log
	    </code>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Note that it is also possible to import all of them using the
	    following syntax</p>
	  <p>  <code>
	      from biogeme.expressions import *
	  </code></p>
	  <p>  although this is not a good Python programming practice. </p>

	  If you have the results of a previous estimation, it may be
	  a good idea to use the estimated values as a starting point
	  for the estimation of a similar models. If not, it depends
	  on the nature of the parameters:
	  <ul>
	    <li>If the parameter is a coefficient (traditionally
	      denoted by &beta;), the value 0 is
	      appropriate.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter is a nest parameter of a nested or
	      cross-nested logit model (traditionally
	      denoted by &mu;), the value 1 is
	      appropriate. Make sure to define the lower bound of the
	      parameter to 1.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter is the nest membership coefficient of
	    a cross-nested logit model (traditionally
	      denoted by &alpha;), the value 0.5 is
	    appropriate. Make sure to define the lower bound to 0 and
	      the upper bound to 1.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter captures the membership to a class of
	    a latent class model, the value 0.5 is appropriate. Make
	      sure to define the lower bound to 0 and
	      the upper bound to 1.</li>
	    <li>If the parameter is the scale of an error component in
	      a mixture of logit model (traditionally
	      denoted by &sigma;), the value must be sufficient
	      large so that the likelihood of each observation is not
	      too close to zero. It is suggested to try first with the
	      value one. If there are numerical issues, try a larger
	      value, such as 10. See Section 7 in the report
	      "Estimating choice models  with latent variables
	      with PandasBiogeme" for a detailed discussion. </li>

      <div id="q3" class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading">Can I save intermediate iterations
	    during the estimation?</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  <p>
	  Yes. Use the parameter <code>saveIterations</code> in the
	  <code>estimate</code>
	  function (see
	  documentation <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.estimate">here</a>).  Each time the value of the log
	  likelihood function is improved, Biogeme will save the
	  current value of all parameters in a file. The name of the
	  file is defined by the
	  parameter <code>file_iterations</code>. By default, it
	  is <code>__savedIterations.txt</code>.
	  If you want to start the iterations from the values in the
	  file, call the function <code>loadSavedIteration</code>
	  (documentation <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.loadSavedIteration">here</a>)
	  before starting the estimation. </p><p>Example:
	  <pre>
	    biogeme = bio.BIOGEME(database, logprob)
	    fname = "myIterations.log"
	    biogeme.loadSavedIteration(filename=fname)
	    results = biogeme.estimate(saveIterations=True, file_iterations=fname)
	  </pre>
	  </p>
	</div>
      </div>

      <div id="q4" class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading">Does Biogeme provide support for
	    out-of-sample validation?</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  <p>
	    Yes. 
	    <ul>
	      <li>You can extract a random sample of the database (see
	      <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html#biogeme.database.Database.sampleWithoutReplacement">documentation</a>).</li>
	      <li>You can split your database into slices, and
	      generate estimation and validation data sets (see <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html#biogeme.database.Database.split">documentation</a> ). </li>
	      <li>You can use the <code>validate</code> function
	      (see <a href="">documentation</a>) to perform a full
	      validation.  The validation consists in organizing the
	      data into several slices of about the same size,
	      randomly defined. Each slice is considered as a
	      validation dataset. The model is then re-estimated using
	      all the data except the slice, and the estimated model
	      is applied on the validation set (i.e. the slice). The
	      value of the log likelihood for each observation in the
	      validation set is reported in a dataframe. As this is
	      done for each slice, the output is a list of dataframes,
	      each corresponding to one of these exercises. See
	      example <code><a href="examples/swissmetro/04validation.py">04validation.py</a>
	      from <a href="examples.html#swissmetro">here</a>. </li>
	    </ul>
	</div>
      </div>

      <div id="q5" class="panel panel-default">
	<div class="panel-heading">The init loglikelihood is <code>-1.797693e+308</code>
 and no iteration is performed. What should I do?</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  <p>If the model returns a probability 0 for the chosen
	  alternative for at least one observation in the sample, then
	  the likelihood is 0, and the log likelihood is minus
	  infinity. For the sake of robustness, Biogeme assigns the
	  value <code>-1.797693e+308</code> to the log likelihood in
	  this context. 
	  </p>
	  <p>A common reason why the model returns a probability 0 for
	    the chosen alternative is when it is declared
	    unavailable. The following code allows to verify that the
	    availability conditions are compatible with the choice
	    variable:
	    <pre>
	      diagnostic = database.checkAvailabilityOfChosenAlt(av, CHOICE)

	      if not diagnostic.all():
	          row_indices = np.where(diagnostic == False)[0]
	          print(f'Rows where the chosen alternative is not available: {row_indices}')
	      
	    </pre>
	    See the documentation
	    of <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=checkavailabilityofchosenalt#biogeme.database.Database.checkAvailabilityOfChosenAlt"><code>checkAvailabilityOfChosenAlt</code> here</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>Another reason is when the initial value of a scale
	  parameter is too close to zero. See the discussion <a href="#q2">here</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>But there are many other possible reasons. The best way
	  to investigate the source of the problem is to use Biogeme
	  in simulation mode, and report the probability of the chosen
	  alternative for each observation. Once you have identified
	  the problematic entries, it is easier to investigate the
	    reason why the model returns a probability of zero.
