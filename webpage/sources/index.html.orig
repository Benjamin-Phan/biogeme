	  Biogeme is a open source <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> package designed for the
		  maximum likelihood estimation of parametric models
		  in general, with a special emphasis on discrete
	          choice models. It relies on the
		  package <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Python Data
		  Analysis Library called Pandas</a>.
</p>
<p>Biogeme used to be a stand alone software package, written in
	  C++. All the material related to the previous versions of
	  Biogeme are available on
	  the <a href="http://transp-or.epfl.ch/pythonbiogeme/"  target="_blank">old

	    <dt>Optimization</dt>
	    <dd>New optimization algorithms are
	    available for estimation See the documentation of
	    the <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=algorithm#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.estimate"><code>estimate</code></a>
	    function, and

	      <a href="examples/swissmetro/01logit_allAlgos.py">example.</a></dd>
	    <dt>Stochastic log likelihood</dt>
	    <dd>It is now possible to calculate the log likelihood
	    function on a sample (a batch) of the full data
	    file. This is particularly useful with large
	    databases. It can be used in the implementation of a
	    stochastic gradient algorithm, for instance. See <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=calculatelikelihood#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.calculateLikelihoodAndDerivatives">documentation</a>.</dd>
	    <dt>User's notes</dt>
	    <dd>It is possible to include your own notes in the HTML
	    file using the <code>userNotes</code> parameter of the
	    <code>biogeme</code>
	    object. See <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=usernotes#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME"
	    target="_blank">documentation</a>. See
	    <a href="examples/swissmetro/01logitBis.py">example</a>.</dd>
	    <dt>Scaling</dt>
	    <dd>It is possible to have Biogeme suggesting the scales
	    of the variables in the database using
	    the <code>suggestScales</code> parameter of
	    the <code>biogeme</code>
	    object. See <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=suggestscales#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.__init__"
			   target="_blank">documentation</a>.</dd>
	    <dt>Estimation</dt>
	    <dd>A new function <code>quickEstimate</code> performs
	    the estimation of the parameters, and skips the
	    calculation of the
	      statistics. See <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=quickestimate#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.quickEstimate">documentation</a>. </dd>
	    <dt>Validation</dt>
	    <dd>A new function in the <code>database</code> module allows to split the database in order to
	    prepare an estimation and a validation sets, for
	    out-of-sample
	    validation. See <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=split#biogeme.database.Database.split">documentation</a>. It
	    is used by the new function <code>validate</code> in the
	    <code>biogeme</code> module. See <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=validate#biogeme.biogeme.BIOGEME.validate">documentation</a>. See <a href="examples/swissmetro/04validation.py">example</a>.</dd>
	    <dt>Messages</dt>
	    <dd>A new function allows to extract all the messages
	    generated during a
	    run. See <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=allmessages#biogeme.messaging.bioMessage.allMessages">documentation</a>. See
	    <a href

	    is also possible to make the logger temporarily silent
	    using the functions <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=temporarysilent#biogeme.messaging.bioMessage.temporarySilence"><code>temporarySilence</code></a> and <a href="sphinx/biogeme.html?highlight=resume#biogeme.messaging.bioMessage.resume"><code>resume</code>.</a></dd>

<p>Several versions of Biogeme have been developed over the
  years. Several names of animals appear: Gnu, Bison, Python, and now, Pandas. </p>
<dl>
  <dt>Version -1: HieLoW</dt>
  <dd>	 <p>   Around 1990, Michel Bierlaire wrote a software package
	      called <em>HieLoW: Hierarchical Logit for
	      Windows</em>. It was written in Borland C++, and was the
	      first discrete choice estimation software with a
	      graphical user interface. It was designed for the
	      estimation of logit and nested logit models. The user
	      had to specify the models through a graphical user
	      interface.  This software was distributed by Stratec SA,
	      Brussels.</p>
</dd>
  <dt>Version 1: BisonBiogeme</dt>
  <dd><p> Around 2000, the first version of Biogeme was
	    released. Written in GNU C++, it was the first open source
	    discrete choice software. It was designed to estimate the
	    parameters of a list of predetermined discrete choice
	    models such as logit, binary probit, nested logit,
	    cross-nested logit, multivariate extreme value models,
	    discrete and continuous mixtures of multivariate extreme
	    value models, models with nonlinear utility functions,
	    models designed for panel data, and heteroscedastic
	    models. The modeling language was designed to be simple,
	    and was developed using a a general-purpose parser
	    generator
	    called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/"
	    target="_blank">GNU Bison</a>. Later, it will be referred
      to as BisonBiogeme. The
	    distributions can be found <a href='archives.html'>here</a>.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="http://transp-or.epfl.ch/pythonbiogeme/"
    target="_blank">Version 2: PythonBiogeme</a></dt>
  <dd><p>
	    Around 2010, a more flexible version was designed for general purpose parametric models.  The  modeling language was extended, and based on
	    the Python language. A series of discrete
choice models were precoded for an easy use. Also written in GNU C++, the
	    distributions can be found <a href='archives.html'>here</a>.
     </p></dd>
  <dt>Version 3: PandasBiogeme</dt>
  <dd><p>In 2018, a completely new version of the software was
	  released. It was not anymore a standalone executable, but a
	  Python package. The package is written in Python, with the
	  exception of the core calculations of the models, that are
	  written in C++ for the sake of efficiency.  The motivation
	  was to combine the simplicity of the usage (especially for
	  teaching purposes), with the sophistication provided by
	  Python (for research and applications purposes). Morever, the management of the data relies on the
	  package Pandas, which has become the workhorse of data
	  scientists. Therefore, the name PandasBiogeme has been
	  adopted. It is distributed on the
	   <a href="https://pypi.org/project/biogeme/" target="_blank">Python
	  Package Index</a> repository.
